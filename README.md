HOME AUTOMATION & WEATHER STATION WITH AI PREDICTIONS
This application provides a comprehensive solution for smart home management, integrating Internet of Things (IoT) device control with real-time weather monitoring, historical data visualization, and AI-powered future weather predictions.

1. WHY WE NEED THIS APPLICATION
In today's interconnected world, managing various home devices and staying informed about environmental conditions often requires juggling multiple apps and sources. Current solutions often suffer from:

Disparate Control: IoT devices are typically controlled through separate applications, leading to fragmented user experiences.

Lack of Contextual Awareness: Home automation systems rarely integrate real-time weather data, limiting their ability to make intelligent, context-aware decisions (e.g., turning on fans based on temperature or sprinklers based on rain probability).

Limited Historical Insight: Users lack tools to review past environmental conditions, making it hard to understand trends or troubleshoot device behavior.

Absence of Proactive Measures: Without future weather predictions, users cannot take proactive steps (like adjusting HVAC before a heatwave or preparing for heavy rainfall).

This application addresses these challenges by offering a centralized platform that unifies device control, provides rich environmental insights, and empowers users with predictive capabilities, leading to more efficient, comfortable, and responsive smart homes.

2. WHAT IS THIS APPLICATION?
This application is a full-stack web solution that combines hardware interaction with robust software services to create an intelligent home environment. It features:

Integrated IoT Device Control: Remotely control connected relays (e.g., for lights, fans, appliances) through a user-friendly web interface.

Real-time Weather Monitoring: Display current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and weather descriptions for a specified location.

Historical Weather Tracking: Visualize past temperature and humidity readings over time, allowing users to observe trends and patterns.

Astronomy Data: Provides current moon phase and sunrise/sunset times for contextual awareness.

AI-Powered Weather Predictions: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict future weather trends (temperature, precipitation, conditions) based on current live data for any city. Users can specify the number of hours for the forecast.

Intuitive User Interface: A responsive and easy-to-navigate web interface for accessing all features.

3. HOW WE MADE THIS
This application is built using a modern full-stack architecture, leveraging popular technologies and reliable weather APIs.

Technology Stack:
Frontend (UI):

React.js: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.

Chart.js: A JavaScript charting library for visualizing historical weather data.

WebSocket API: For real-time updates from the backend to the frontend (e.g., live weather, device status changes).

Backend (API Gateway & Data Orchestration):

Node.js (Express.js): A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for building the server-side API.

Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to external weather services and the Flask ML backend.

node-cron: For scheduling periodic data fetches (e.g., every 5 minutes for current weather, every 3 hours for forecasts).

ws (WebSocket Library): For implementing real-time communication with the frontend.

dotenv: To securely manage API keys and environment variables.

Machine Learning (AI/ML Predictions):

Flask (Python): A micro web framework for Python, serving as the API endpoint for the AI/ML model.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preparing input for the ML model.

Custom ML Model (Python): The predictor.py module houses the machine learning logic (currently a mock for demonstration, but designed to be replaced with a trained model for rain and weather trend prediction).

Flask-CORS: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for seamless communication between the Node.js backend and the Flask ML service.

IoT Device (Hardware):

ESP8266 Microcontroller: A low-cost Wi-Fi microchip used to control physical relays and potentially integrate sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity) for local readings. It exposes a simple HTTP API for control and status.

APIs Used:
OpenWeatherMap API: Used for fetching general weather data and 5-day forecasts.

WeatherAPI.com: Used for fetching live, current weather data and astronomy details, providing granular data like dew point and wind details for ML model input.

Custom ESP8266 Device API: An internal HTTP API exposed by the ESP8266 device for relay control and status retrieval.

Data Sources & AI/ML Approach:
Live Data: Current weather observations are fetched from WeatherAPI.com, formatted, and then sent to the Flask ML model.

Historical Data: While the primary use case for historical data in the UI is a local history buffer, the underlying concept for training the ML model would involve large historical weather datasets. For developing AI/ML models, publicly available datasets such as NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily), ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis data, and data from Meteostat are excellent choices for training. These sources provide long-term records of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, pressure, and other relevant meteorological parameters crucial for training predictive models for rain probability and future weather trends.

Prediction Model: The AI/ML model (in predictor.py) would be trained on historical weather data to identify patterns and relationships between various meteorological parameters and future weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and the likelihood of precipitation in the coming hours). When a prediction request comes in, the live data for the given city acts as the input features for this model, which then generates the future trend forecast.

This application demonstrates a practical integration of web technologies, IoT, and machine learning to build a smarter, more responsive home automation system.
